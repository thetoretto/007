[33m992cd7c384116723a1070f86594b403fed51c21b[m - Data Structure: I extracted the benefit details for passengers and drivers into separate arrays ( passengerBenefits and driverBenefits ) for better organization and maintainability. - Reusable Component: I created a new BenefitCard component to display individual benefits consistently. This component takes the icon, title, and description as props. - Dynamic Rendering: The main component now maps over these arrays to render a BenefitCard for each benefit item. - Layout Adjustment: The layout was updated to use a grid for the main sections ('For Passengers' and 'For Drivers') and vertical spacing ( space-y-6 ) within each section to stack the individual benefit cards neatly. Each benefit now appears in its own card, but they remain visually grouped under the appropriate headings.
[33m55e0d1fac6618c166eedbf044506e719bbc388c9[m - feat: Add Contact Page: Created a new contact page with a form and contact details, styled with Tailwind CSS, and added the corresponding route. - style: Apply Pocket UI Template: Refreshed the application's UI by updating components (Navbar, Footer, HomePage, ContactPage, various forms, buttons) to align with the Tailwind UI 'Pocket' template aesthetic. - fix: Resolve BookingWidget Compilation Errors: Removed duplicate React imports and a duplicate component definition in BookingWidget.tsx . - style: Improve Vehicle Page Layout: Added standard page container, Navbar, and Footer to VehiclePage.tsx to ensure consistent layout for the VehicleManagement
[33m247beb7c02abf6804678cb0a162311dcb41e364a[m - Driver Vehicle Management: Implemented features for drivers to add and edit their vehicles, including selection dropdowns for brand and model. - Trip Creation Enhancements: Updated the trip creation form to utilize driver vehicles, incorporate a price field, use 'From' and 'To' location inputs instead of predefined routes, and added a field for notes. - Admin User Management: Enhanced the admin user management page with a dashboard view and full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for users. - Driver Statistics: Added sorting functionality to the driver statistics page. - Passenger Trips Page: Improved the layout of the passenger trips page and added sorting capabilities. - Bug Fixes: Resolved several errors related to undefined variables and incorrect import paths across different components.

[33mbfa330b1d6fbeb99e3577ef1bbb5ee35836dc50b[m ### Backend - Static Development Credentials: Implemented in devCredentials.js for development mode. - Login Logic: Refactored to use static credentials in development ( NODE_ENV=development ), bypassing JWT/session and database for login. - Auth Middleware: Disabled for all routes in development mode. - Signup/Password Reset: Dynamic registration and password logic removed/commented for development. - Production Auth: Real authentication code is preserved and still works when NODE_ENV is not development . ### Frontend - Login Form: Updated to accept either email or phone number. - Login Logic: Sends both email and phone number fields as needed. - Signup/Password Reset UI: Should be removed/hidden for development, but check if any UI elements remain. - Login Issue: If you still cannot log in, double-check that:   - The backend is running in development mode ( NODE_ENV=development ).   - The frontend is sending the correct payload (email or phoneNumber + password).   - The credentials match those in devCredentials.js . ### Next Steps - Commit: You can safely commit all changes. Make sure to include a commit message like:   plaintext
