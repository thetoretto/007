# Road Service Application (RSA) Documentation

## Overview
The Road Service Application (RSA) is a modern web application built with React and TypeScript that facilitates booking transportation services. It features a multi-step booking process, user authentication, and role-based access control.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React

### Core Features
1. Multi-step Booking Process
2. User Authentication
3. Role-based Access (Passenger, Driver, Admin)
4. Real-time Price Calculation
5. Responsive Design

## Components Structure

### Booking Flow
The booking process is implemented as a multi-step wizard with the following steps:

1. **Route Selection** (`RouteSelection.tsx`)
   - Displays available routes
   - Allows users to select origin and destination

2. **Vehicle Selection** (`VehicleSelection.tsx`)
   - Shows available vehicles for the selected route
   - Displays vehicle details and capacity

3. **Seat Selection** (`SeatSelection.tsx`)
   - Interactive seat map
   - Real-time seat availability

4. **Schedule** (`Schedule.tsx`)
   - Date and time slot selection
   - Availability calendar

5. **Review** (`Review.tsx`)
   - Trip summary
   - Price breakdown
   - Booking details confirmation

6. **Payment** (`Payment.tsx`)
   - Secure payment processing
   - Multiple payment methods
   - Booking confirmation

### State Management

#### Booking Store (`bookingStore.ts`)
Manages the entire booking flow state including:
- Current step tracking
- Selected route, vehicle, and seat
- Schedule and extras
- Price calculation
- Booking completion

#### Authentication Store (`authStore.ts`)
Handles user authentication and session management:
- User login/logout
- Session persistence
- Role-based access control

## User Interface

### Design System
- Consistent color scheme using Tailwind's primary and secondary colors
- Responsive layout with mobile-first approach
- Interactive elements with hover and focus states
- Loading states and error handling

### Common Components
- `ProgressBar`: Visual indicator of booking progress
- `LoadingSpinner`: Animated loading indicator
- `Navbar`: Main navigation component

## Booking Flow Details

### Step 1: Route Selection
- Users can search and select from available routes
- Route details include distance, duration, and base fare

### Step 2: Vehicle Selection
- Displays vehicles available for the selected route
- Shows vehicle capacity, model, and features

### Step 3: Seat Selection
- Interactive seat map showing available and occupied seats
- Real-time seat status updates

### Step 4: Schedule
- Calendar view for date selection
- Available time slots for the selected date

### Step 5: Review
- Comprehensive trip summary
- Price breakdown including:
  - Base fare
  - Service fees
  - Extra services
  - Applicable discounts

### Step 6: Payment
- Secure payment form
- Multiple payment method options
- Booking confirmation with reference number

## Price Calculation
The total price is calculated based on:
1. Base fare for the selected route
2. Service fees
3. Additional services (e.g., doorstep pickup)
4. Applied discounts

## Authentication System
